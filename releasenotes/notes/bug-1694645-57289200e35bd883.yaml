    Fix a bug that netboot is unavailable with virtual media boot in an
    environment using syslinux 5.00 or later such as Ubuntu 16.04. This is
    caused by a change in syslinux that ldlinux.c32 is required for creating
    boot ISO. This file is searched in the following general paths:

      * /usr/lib/syslinux/modules/bios/ldlinux.c32
      * /usr/share/syslinux/ldlinux.c32

    This path can be set with the configuration parameter
    ``[DEFAULT]/ldlinux_c32`` for another distribution or for a case where the
    path is changed with future update.

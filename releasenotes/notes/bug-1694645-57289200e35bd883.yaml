    Fixes a bug whereby netboot was unavailable with virtual media boot in an
    environment using syslinux 5.00 or later, such as Ubuntu 16.04. This was
    caused by a syslinux change; the ldlinux.c32 file is required for creating
    a boot ISO. To address this, the new configuration option
    ``[DEFAULT]/ldlinux_32`` can be set to the path of the ldlinux.c32 file.
    If not specified, the default is to look for the file in the paths:

      * /usr/lib/syslinux/modules/bios/ldlinux.c32
      * /usr/share/syslinux/ldlinux.c32

    For baremetal operations on DHCPv6-stateful networks multiple IPv6
    addresses can now be allocated for neutron ports created for provisioning,
    cleaning, rescue or inspection. The new parameter
    ``[neutron]/dhcpv6_stateful_address_count`` controls the number of addresses
    to allocate (Default: 4).

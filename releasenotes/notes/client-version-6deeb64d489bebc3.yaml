fixes:
  - Updating the python-oneviewclient minimum version to 2.5.1 on
    driver-requirements.txt. The minimum version that was in the requirements
    was 2.0.2, and is very outdated, causing the driver to not work for this
    version. With this change, the new minimal version works for the driver,
    making the CI for stable/newton also work.

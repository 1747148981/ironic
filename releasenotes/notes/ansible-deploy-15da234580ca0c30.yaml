    Adds a new ``ansible`` deploy interface. It targets mostly undercloud
    use-case by allowing greater customization of provisioning process.

    This new deploy interface is usable only with hardware types.
    It is set as supported for a ``generic`` hardware type and all
    its subclasses, but must be explicitly enabled in the
    ``[DEFAULT]enabled_deploy_interfaces`` configuration file option
    to actually allow setting nodes to use it.

    For migration from the ``staging-ansible`` interface from the
    ``ironic-staging-drivers`` project to this ``ansible`` interface,
    operators have to consider the following differences:

    - callback-less operation is not supported
    - driver_info fields 'ansible_deploy_username' and
      'ansible_deploy_key_file' are deprecated and will be removed
      in the Rocky release, use 'ansible_username' and 'ansible_key_file'
      respectively
    - base path for playbooks can be defined in driver_info as well
      (as 'ansible_playbooks_path' field, defaults to the value of
      ``[ansible]/playbooks_path`` from ironic configuration file
    - default playbooks for actions and cleaning steps file can be set in
      ironic configuration file as various ``[ansible]/default_*`` options.

    Please read the ``ansible`` deploy interface documentation for more
    information.

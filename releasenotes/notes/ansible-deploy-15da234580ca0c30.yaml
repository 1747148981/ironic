    Adds a new ``ansible`` deploy interface. It targets mostly undercloud
    use-case by allowing greater customization of provisioning process.

    This new deploy interface is usable only with hardware types.
    It is set as supported for a ``generic`` hardware type and all
    its subclasses, but must be explicitly enabled in the
    ``[DEFAULT]enabled_deploy_interfaces`` configuration file option
    to actually allow setting nodes to use it.

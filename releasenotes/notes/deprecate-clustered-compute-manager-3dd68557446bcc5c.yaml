    In Nova commit 6047d790a32ef5a65d4d6b029f673ce53c3d4141,
    functionality is added to the ironic virt
    driver to support multiple compute hosts without using the hack
    we call ClusteredComputeManager.

    We anticipate this being included in the Newton release of Nova.
    In advance of that, we are marking this unsupported component
    as deprecated, and plan to remove it before the end of the Ocata
    development cycle.

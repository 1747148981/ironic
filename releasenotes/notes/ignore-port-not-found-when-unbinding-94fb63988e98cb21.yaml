fixes:
  - Fixes a failure when deploying a node. This happened when a port or port
    group's internal_info['tenant_vif_port_id'] still existed after the
    corresponding neutron port was removed and prior to deletion of the
    instance, causing future deployments of the bare metal node to fail. The
    situation is now logged and does not block future deployments. See
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/1685592 for details.

deprecations:
  - |
    Configuration option ``[inspector]/service_url`` is deprecated
    and will be ignored in the Rocky release.
    Instead, use ``[inspector]/endpoint_override`` configuration option to set
    specific ironic-inspector api address when automatic discovery of
    inspector API endpoint from keystone catalog is not desired.
    This new option has no default value (``None``) and must be set explicitly.

  - |
    Relying on the value of ``[DEFAULT]/auth_strategy`` configuration option to
    configure usage of standalone mode for inspector client is deprecated and
    will be impossible the the Rocky release.
    Instead, set ``[inspector]/auth_type`` configuration option to ``none`` and
    provide the inspector API address as ``[inspector]/endpoint_override``
    configuration option.

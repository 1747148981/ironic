upgrade:

    Adds new data migration ``migrate_to_hardware_types`` that will try to
    migrate nodes from classic drivers to hardware types on upgrade. Matching
    hardware types and interfaces have to be provided on classic drivers
    themselves. Nodes that cannot be migrated are skipped. This can primary
    happen for three reasons:

    * migration is not implemented for the classic driver,
    * the matching hardware type is not enabled,
    * one or more matching hardware interfaces are not enabled.

    In the latter case, the new migration command line option
    ``reset_unsupported_interfaces`` can be used to reset optional interfaces
    (all except for ``boot``, ``deploy``, ``management`` and ``power``) to
    their no-op implementations (e.g. ``no-inspect``) if the matching
    implementation is not enabled. Use it like::

        ironic-dbsync online_data_migrations --option migrate_to_hardware_types.reset_unsupported_interfaces=true

    This migration can be repeated several times to migrate skipped nodes
    after the configuration is changed.

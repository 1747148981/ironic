    Adds virtual media boot interface to ``redfish`` hardware type supporting
    virtual media boot. The ``redfish-virtual-media`` boot interface operates
    on the same kernel/ramdisk as, for example, PXE boot interface does, however
    ``redfish-virtual-media`` boot interface can additionally require EFI
    system partition image (ESP) when performing UEFI boot. New configuration
    option ``bootloader`` or ``[driver_info]/bootloader`` property can be used
    to convey ESP location to ironic. Bootable ISO images can be served to
    BMC either from Swift or from a HTTP server running on ironic conductor
    machine. This is controlled by the ``[redfish]use_swift`` ironic
    configuration option.

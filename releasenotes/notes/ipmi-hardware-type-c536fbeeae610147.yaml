    Introduces new hardware type ``ipmi`` for IPMI-compatible hardware.
    This type is enabled by default. Uses ``ipmitool`` utility under the hood,
    similar to existing classic drivers ``pxe_ipmitool`` and
    ``agent_ipmitool``. Supports both types of serial console: via
    ``shellinabox`` and via ``socat``, both are disabled by default.

    Adds support for node retirement by adding a ``retired`` property
    to the node. If set, a node moves upon automatic cleaning to
    ``manageable`` (rather than ``available``). The new property can also
    block the provide keyword, i.e. nodes cannot move from ``manageable``
    to ``available``. Furthermore, there is an additional optional property
    ``retirement_reason`` to store the reason for the node's retirement.

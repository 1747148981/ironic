    Agent lookup/heartbeat as vendor passthru is removed from iLO drivers.
    Affected drivers are

    * agent_ilo
    * iscsi_ilo
    * pxe_ilo

    Other existing vendor passthru methods are left inplace.

upgrade:
  - Agent lookup/heartbeat as vendor passthru is removed from iLO drivers.
    That means that iLO drivers become incompatible with IPA < 1.5.0.
    Operators are required to update their IPA-based deploy ramdisks to
    contain IPA >= 1.5.0.

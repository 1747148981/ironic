upgrade:
  - Ironic no longer supports agent lookup/heartbeats as vendor passthru.
    All out-of-tree drivers must be updated to use AgentDeployMixin classes
    directly without relying on BaseAgentVendor class and other classes
    that were inheriting from it
    (agent.AgentVendorInterface and iscsi_deploy.VendorPassthru).
    This means that Ironic is incompatible with deploy ramdisks based on
    Ironic Python Agent (IPA) < 1.5.0.
    Operators should update their IPA-based deploy ramdisks in this case.
    Operators using non-IPA based deploy ramdisks which use ironic
    lookup/heartbeats functionality must update those to use top-level
    ironic lookup/heartbeats REST API (available since ironic API v1.22).

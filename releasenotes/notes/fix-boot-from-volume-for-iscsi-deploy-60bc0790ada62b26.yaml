    Fixes an issue in boot from volume for ``iscsi`` deploy interface. Boot
    from a volume fails when it is requested for a node having ``iscsi``
    deploy interface, it doesn't create pxelinux.cfg file for mac,
    and failed to boot. See `bug 1714436
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/1714436>`_ for details.

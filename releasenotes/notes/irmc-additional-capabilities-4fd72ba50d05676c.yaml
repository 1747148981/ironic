    Adds new capabilities (``server_model``, ``rom_firmware_version``, ``pci_gpu_devices``,
    ``trusted_boot`` and ``irmc_firmware_version``) to the iRMC out-of-band hardware inspection
    for FUJITSU PRIMERGY bare metal nodes with firmware iRMC S4 and beyond.
    Before inspecting, if a server is powered off, it will be turned on automatically.
    After inspection, power status will be restored to the previous state.

    Update of python-scciclient to version 0.6.0 is required by the iRMC driver to support
    new out-of-band inspection capabilities. If the version is not updated, the new
    capabilities will not be updated.

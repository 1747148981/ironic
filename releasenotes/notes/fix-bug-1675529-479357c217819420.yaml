deprecations:
  - |
    Configuration option IPMI.retry_timeout is deprecated in favor of new
    options IPMI.command_retry_timeout, and
    CONDUCTOR.power_state_change_timeout
fixes:
  - |
    Prevents the IPMI driver from needlessly checking status if the power
    change action fails. Additionally stop retrying power actions and power
    status polls if we receive a non-retryable error from ipmitool.
    https//bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/1675529. New configuration option
    `power_state_change_timeout` added to define how many seconds to wait for a
    server to change power state when a power action is requested.

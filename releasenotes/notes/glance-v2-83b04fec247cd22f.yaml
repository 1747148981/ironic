    Ironic now uses only Image (glance) V2 API by default. Usage of deprecated
    V1 API for certain basic tasks can still be enabled by setting
    "[glance]glance_api_version" to "1". This option, however, does not affect
    temporary URL generation, as it always required V2 API and cannot work
    with V1.

      Adds notifications for:

      * when ironic attempts to set the power state on the node (notifications
        with event type "baremetal.node.power_set.{start, end, error}")
      * when ironic detects the power state on baremetal hardware has changed
        and updates the node in the database appropriately (notifications with
        event type "baremetal.node.power_state_corrected.success")

      These are emitted if notifications are enabled. For more details, see the
      developer documentation.

    Fixes an issue in boot from volume for ``iscsi`` deploy interface. Boot
    from a volume fails when it is requested for a node having ``iscsi``
    deploy interface and no ``image_source`` is provided in node's
    ``node.instance_info``. It fails while trying to perform validation of
    ``image_source``. See `bug 1714147
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/1714147>`_ for details.

    Adds support for booting from remote volumes to ``irmc-virtual-media``
    boot interface. It enables boot configuration for iSCSI or FibreChannel
    via out-of-band network.

    In addition to the same configuration as generic boot-from-volume, this
    interface requires the following settings.

    * It is necessary to set a physical port ID to network ports and volume
      connectors. All cards including those not used for volume boot should be
      registered.

        * A physical ID format is: ``<Card Type><Slot No>-<Port No>``

            ``<Card Type>``
                LAN, FC or CNA
            ``<Slot No>``
                0 indicates onboard slot. Use 1 to 9 for addon slots.
            ``<Port No>``
                A port number starting from 1.

        * Set the IDs to ``node.driver_info.pci_physical_ids``. This parameter
          is a list of pair of UUID of a resource (Port or Volume connector)
          and a physical ID like:

            pci_physical_ids = 1ecd14ee-c191-4007-8413-16bb5d5a73a2:LAN0-1,1ecd14ee-c191-4007-8413-16bb5d5a73a2:CNA1-1

    * For iSCSI, volume connectors with both type ``iqn`` and ``ip`` are
      required. The configuration with DHCP is not supported yet.

    * For iSCSI, a subnet mask of the storage network is necessary. It should
      be set to ``node.driver_info.storage_network_size`` as integer.

    This feature requires specific FC cards or CNAs (Converged Network Adapter).
    See the documentation of iRMC driver for details.

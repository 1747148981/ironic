    Adds version 1.38 of the Bare Metal API, which provides supports for
    rescuing (and unrescuing) a node. This includes:

    *  A node in the ``active`` provision state can be rescued via the
       ``GET /v1/nodes/{node_ident}/states/provision`` API, by specifying
       ``rescue`` as the ``target`` value, and a ``rescue_password``
       value. When the node has been rescued, it will be in the ``rescue``
       provision state. A rescue ramdisk will be running, configured with
       the specified ``rescue_password``, and listening with ssh on the
       tenant network.

    *  A node in the ``rescue`` provision state can be unrescued (to the
       ``active`` state) via the
       ``GET /v1/nodes/{node_ident}/states/provision`` API, by specifying
       ``unrescue`` as the ``target`` value.

    * The ``rescue_interface`` field of the node resource. A rescue
      interface can be set when creating or updating a node.

    * It also exposes ``default_rescue_interface`` and
      ``enable_rescue_interfaces`` fields of the driver resource.

    * Adds new configuration options ``[DEFAULT]/enabled_rescue_interfaces``
      and ``[DEFAULT]/default_rescue_interface``. Rescue interfaces are
      enabled via the ``[DEFAULT]/enabled_rescue_interfaces``. A default
      rescue interface to use when creating or updating nodes can be
      specified with the ``[DEFAULT]/enabled_rescue_interfaces``.

    * Adds new options ``[conductor]/check_rescue_state_interval`` and
      ``[conductor]/rescue_callback_timeout`` to fail the rescue operation
      upon timeout, for the nodes that are stuck in the rescue wait state.

    * Adds support for providing separate ``rescuing`` network with its
      security groups using new options ``[neutron]/rescuing_network`` and
      ``[neutron]/rescuing_network_security_groups`` respectively. It is
      required to provide ``[neutron]/rescuing_network``.

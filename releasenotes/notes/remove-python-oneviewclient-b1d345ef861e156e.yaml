issues:
  - |
    The library ``python-ilorest-library`` is a fork of the
    ``python-redfish-library`` and imported with same name, hence conflict
    when together. ``python-redfish-library`` cannot be used when ``oneview``
    hardware type is in use.
upgrade:
  - |
    The ``oneview`` hardware type now use ``hpOneView`` and
    ``python-ilorest-library`` libraries to communicate with OneView
    appliances. The ``python-oneviewclient`` library is no longer used.
upgrade:
  - |
    Configuration ``[oneview]max_polling_attempts`` is removed since
    ``hpOneView`` doesn't support this option.

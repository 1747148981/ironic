features:
  - Names can now be used instead of UUIDs for "cleaning_network" and
    "provisioning_network" options (former "cleaning_network_uuid" and
    "provisioning_network_uuid"). Care has to be taken to ensure that the
    names are unique among all networks in this case. Note that mapping between
    a name and a UUID is cached for the lifetime of the conductor.
deprecations:
  - Configuration options "[neutron]cleaning_network_uuid" and
    "[neutron]provisioning_network_uuid" were deprecated in favor of new
    "[neutron]cleaning_network" and "[neutron]provisioning_network".

    Add functionality to perform virtual media boot without
    user-built deploy/rescue/boot ISO images for hardware type ilo.
    Instead, ironic will build necessary images out of common
    kernel/ramdisk pair (though user needs to provide ESP image).
    User provided deploy/rescue/boot ISO images are
    also supported.

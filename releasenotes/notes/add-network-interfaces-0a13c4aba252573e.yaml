features:
  - |
    Added network interface. Introduced two network interface implementations:
    ``flat``, which replicates the flat network behavior present previously and
    ``noop`` when neutron is not used, which is basically a noop interface.
    The network interface is used to switch network for node during
    provisioning/cleaning. Added ``enabled_network_interfaces`` option in
    DEFAULT config section. This option defines a list of enabled network
    interfaces on the conductor.
deprecations:
  - |
    ``create_cleaning_ports`` and ``delete_cleaning_ports`` methods in DHCP
    providers are deprecated and will be removed completely in the Ocata
    release. The logic they are implementing should be moved to a custom
    network interface's ``add_cleaning_network`` and
    ``remove_cleaning_network`` methods respectively. After that, the methods
    themselves should be removed from DHCP provider so that network interface
    is used instead. ``flat`` network interface does not require
    ``[neutron]cleaning_network_uuid`` for now so as not to break standalone
    deployments, but it will be required in the Ocata release.
upgrade:
  - |
    ``[DEFAULT]default_network_interface`` configuration option is introduced,
    with empty default value. If set, the specified interface will be used as
    the network interface for nodes that don't have ``network_interface`` field
    set. If it is not set, the network interface is determined by looking at
    the ``[dhcp]dhcp_provider`` value. If it is ``neutron`` - ``flat`` network
    interface is the default, ``noop`` otherwise.
    The network interface will be set for all nodes without network_interface
    already set via a database migration. This will be set following the logic
    above. When running database migrations for an existing deployment, it's
    important to check the above configuration options to ensure the existing
    nodes will have the expected network_interface. If
    ``[DEFAULT]default_network_interface`` is not set, everything should go as
    expected. If it is set, ensure that it is set to the value that you wish
    existing nodes to use.
  - Note that if ``[DEFAULT]default_network_interface`` is set, it must be set
    in the configuration file for both the API and conductor hosts.

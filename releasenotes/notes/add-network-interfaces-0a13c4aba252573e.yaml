features:
  - |
    Added network interface. Introduced two network interface implementations:
    ``flat``, which replicates the flat network behavior present previously and
    ``noop`` when neutron is not used, which is basically a noop interface.
    The network interface is used to switch network for node during
    provisioning/cleaning. Added ``enabled_network_interfaces`` option in
    DEFAULT config section. This option defines a list of enabled network
    interfaces on the conductor.
deprecations:
  - |
    ``create_cleaning_ports`` and ``delete_cleaning_ports`` methods in DHCP
    providers are deprecated and will be removed completely in the Ocata
    release. The logic they are implementing should be moved to a custom
    network interface's ``add_cleaning_network`` and
    ``remove_cleaning_network`` methods respectively. After that, the methods
    themselves should be removed from DHCP provider so that network interface
    is used instead. ``flat`` network interface does not require
    ``[neutron]cleaning_network_uuid`` for now so as not to break standalone
    deployments, but it will be required in the Ocata release.
upgrade:
  - |
    ``[DEFAULT]default_network_interface`` configuration option is introduced,
    with empty default value. If set, the specified interface will be used as
    the network interface for nodes that don't have ``network_interface`` field
    set. If it is not set, the network interface is determined by looking at
    the ``[dhcp]dhcp_provider`` value. If it is ``neutron`` - ``flat`` network
    interface is the default, ``noop`` otherwise.

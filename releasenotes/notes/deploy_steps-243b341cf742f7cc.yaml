features:
  - |
    The `framework for deployment steps
    <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/ironic-specs/specs/approved/deployment-steps-framework.html>`_
    is in place. All in-tree drivers (DeployInterfaces) have one (big) deploy
    step; the conductor executes this step when deploying a node.
deprecations:
  - |
    All drivers must implement their deployment process using `deploy steps`.
    Out-of-tree drivers without deploy steps will be supported until the T* release.

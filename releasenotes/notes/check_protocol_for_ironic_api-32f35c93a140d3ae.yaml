fixes:
  - Accepting ``[conductor]/api_url`` value specified in the configuration
    file that does not start with either ``https://`` or ``http://``.
    Such value leads to deployment failure on ironic-python-agent side.
    This misconfiguration will be detected during ironic-conductor
    and ironic-api start. An exception will be raised and an error about
    the invalid value will be logged.

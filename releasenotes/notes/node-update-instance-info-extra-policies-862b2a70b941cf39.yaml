    Adds ``baremetal:node:update_extra`` and ``baremetal:node:instance_info``
    policies to allow finer-grained policy control over node updates. In order
    to use standalone Ironic to provision a node, a user must be able to
    update these attributes, and a lessee should not be able to update all
    node attributes.

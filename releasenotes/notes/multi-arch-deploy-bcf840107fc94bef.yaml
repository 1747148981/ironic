features:
  - Support multi architecture deployment. E.g., to
    deploy x86_64, aarch64 servers by one ironic conductor.
    Two new config options, ``pxe_config_template_by_arch``
    and ``pxe_bootfile_name_by_arch``, are introduced to
    support multi architecture deployment. They are
    dictionary values to hold pxe config templates and
    boot files for multiple architectures, with cpu_arch
    property per node as the key. If cpu_arch is not found
    in dictionary, options ``pxe_config_template``,
    ``pxe_bootfile_name``, ``uefi_pxe_config_template``,
    ``uefi_pxe_bootfile_name`` will be used as usual.

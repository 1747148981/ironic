    Adds, starting with REST API version 1.24:

    * the new endpoint `v1/nodes/<node>/portgroups`;
    * the new endpoint `v1/portgroups/<portgroup>/ports`;
    * the new field `portgroup_uuid` to a port. This is the UUID
      of a port group that this port belongs to, or None if it doesn't
      belong to any port group.

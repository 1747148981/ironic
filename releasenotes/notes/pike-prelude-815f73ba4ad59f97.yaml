    The 9.0.0 (Pike) release includes many new features and bug fixes.

    Please review the upgrade section which describes the required actions to
    upgrade your installation from 7.0.x (Ocata) to 9.0.0 (Pike).

    A few major changes are worth mentioning. This is not an exhaustive list:

    - It is now possible to do rolling upgrades, starting with upgrading Ocata
      to Pike. For details, see
      https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/upgrade-guide.html.

    - The long-awaited support to boot from volumes is here. For details, see
      https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/boot-from-volume.html.

    - Full support for "dynamic" drivers is available. There are hardware types
      for all "classic" drivers. The use of hardware types is preferred over
      the use of "classic" drivers, since "classic" drivers may be deprecated
      in Queens.

    - ``redfish`` is a new hardware type that supports the Redfish standard.

    - The Compute service is changing the way bare metal nodes are scheduled,
      and will be using the node's ``resource_class`` to do this. For more
      details, see
      https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/install/configure-nova-flavors.html#scheduling-based-on-resource-classes.

    - The Bare Metal service can now incorporate physical network information
      when attaching virtual interfaces (VIFs) via the new ``physical_network``
      field to the port object. For details, see
      https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/multitenancy.html#multitenancy-physnets.

    - The ssh-based drivers have been removed from ironic. Please see the
      "Upgrade Notes" section for more information.

    Adds power state change callbacks of an instance to the Compute service by
    performing API notifications. This is configurable through the
    ``nova.send_power_notifications`` config option. Whenever there is a change
    in the power state of a physical instance (for example a "power on" or
    "power off" API command is issued or during the periodic power state
    synchronization between nova and ironic) the Baremetal service will create
    and send a ``power-update`` external event to the Compute service which will
    cause the power state of the instance to be updated in its database. It
    also adds the possibility of bringing up/down a physical instance through
    the Baremetal service API even if it was put down/up through the Compute
    service API.
fixes:

    By immediately conveying all the power state changes (note that the
    Baremetal service only sends requests to the Compute service if the target
    power state is either "power on" or "power off") of an instance through
    external events to the Compute service, the Baremetal service becomes the
    source of truth thus preventing the Compute service from forcing wrong
    power states on the instance during the periodic power state
    synchronization between nova and ironic. An exception would be if a race
    condition were to occur due to the nova-ironic power sync task happening
    a nano-second before the power state change event is received from the
    Baremetal service in which case the nova instance state will be forced
    on the baremetal node.

    In order to support power state change call backs to nova, the ``[nova]``
    section must be configured in the baremetal service configuration.

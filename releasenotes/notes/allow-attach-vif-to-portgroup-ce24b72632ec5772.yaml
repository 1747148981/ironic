features:
  - Enables port group usage when attaching/detaching VIFs.
    When attaching a VIF to a node, it is attached to the first free port
    group. Port group is considered free if it has no VIFs attached to any of
    its ports. Otherwise, only the unattached ports of this portgroup are
    available for attachment. If there are no free port groups, the first
    available port (pxe_enabled has higher priority) is used instead.
deprecations:
  - Using portgroup.extra['vif_port_id'] for attaching/detaching
    VIFs to port groups is deprecated and will be removed in Pike release.

      Exposes the ``network_interface`` field of the Node resource to the REST
      API, raising the API maximum version to 1.20. This field is the network
      interface to use for a node. Its possible values are from the
      configuration option ``[DEFAULT]enabled_network_interfaces``. Note that
      the value of this option must be the same on all the ironic-conductor and
      ironic-api service nodes.

    Agent lookup/heartbeat as vendor passthru is removed from most of
    in-tree ironic drivers. Affected drivers are

    * agent_ipmitool
    * agent_ipmitool_socat
    * agent_ipminative
    * agent_irmc
    * agent_ssh
    * agent_vbox
    * agent_ucs
    * pxe_agent_cimc
    * pxe_ipmitool
    * pxe_ipmitool_socat
    * pxe_ssh
    * pxe_ipminative
    * pxe_seamicro
    * pxe_snmp
    * pxe_irmc
    * pxe_vbox
    * pxe_msftocs
    * pxe_ucs
    * pxe_iscsi_cimc
    * pxe_drac
    * pxe_drac_inspector
    * iscsi_irmc

    All the other vendor passthru methods are left in place if the
    driver had them.
upgrade:
  - Agent lookup/heartbeat as vendor passthru is removed from ironic.
    That means that most in-tree drivers relying on Ironic Python Agent (IPA)
    lookup/heartbeat functionality become incompatible with IPA < 1.5.0.
    Operators are required to update their IPA-based deploy ramdisks to
    contain IPA >= 1.5.0.

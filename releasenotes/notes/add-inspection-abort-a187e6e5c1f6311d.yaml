    Adds support to abort the inspection of a node in the ``inspect wait``
    state, as long as this operation is supported by the inspect interface in
    use. Starting from API 1.41, the node in the ``inspect wait`` state
    accepts ``abort`` provisioning verb to initiate the abort process.
    This feature is supported by the ``inspector`` inspect interface.

    Fixes an issue where the ``timeout`` that was specified for a node's
    power state transition was not used for the *ipmitool*, *irmc* and
    *oneview* Power Interfaces.
    See `bug 1746849 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/1746849>`_
    for details.

    The ironic-conductor expects that all PowerInterface's set_power_state()
    and reboot() methods accept a ``timeout`` parameter. Any out-of-tree
    implementations that don't, will cause TypeError exceptions to be raised.

    Fixes a bug 1702158, where the wrong database engine is used for the
    conductor_hardware_interfaces table, if the system is using MySQL prior to
    version 5.5 (or the default_storage_engine option is set explicitly to
    'MyISAM' in my.cnf). In this case, a table could be created with MyISAM
    engine and foreign key constraint conductor_id(conductors.id) ignored.

    Due to a bug 1702158, conductor_hardware_interfaces table could be created
    with MyISAM database engine, while all other tables in ironic database are
    using InnoDB engine. This could happen during initial installation, or
    upgrade to ocata release, if the system is using MySQL prior to version 5.5
    (or the default_storage_engine option is set explicitly to 'MyISAM' in
    my.cnf). If this is the case, conductor_hardware_interfaces needs to be
    manually migrated to InnoDB, and foreign key constraint re-created::

      alter table conductor_hardware_interfaces engine='InnoDB';
      alter table conductor_hardware_interfaces
        add constraint conductor_hardware_interfaces_ibfk_1
        foreign key (conductor_id) references conductors(id);

    To facilitate automatic discovery of services from the keystone catalog,
    the configuration file sections for service clients may include these
    configuration options: ``service_type``, ``service_name``,
    ``valid_interfaces``, ``region_name`` and other keystoneauth Adaper-related
    options.

    These options together must uniquely specify an endpoint for a service
    registered in the keystone catalog.
    Consult the ``keystoneauth`` library documentation for full list of
    available options, their meaning and possible values.

    Default values for ``service_type`` are set by ironic to sane defaults
    based on required services and their entries in ``service-types-authority``.

    The ``valid_interfaces`` option defaults to ``['internal', 'public']``.

    The ``region_name`` option defaults to ``None`` and must be explicitly set
    for multi-regional setup for endpoint discovery to succeed.

    The configuration file sections where these new options are available are:

    - service_catalog

features:
  - |
    Options for service endpoint discovery can now be set per-service in
    appropriate service configuration file sections:

    - ``[service_catalog]`` for baremetal API discovery

deprecations:
  - |
    Configuration option ``[conductor]api_url`` is deprecated
    and will be ignored in the Rocky release.
    Instead, use ``[service_catalog]endpoint_override`` configuration option
    to set specific ironic API address if automatic discovery of ironic API
    endpoint from keystone catalog is not desired.
    This new option defaults to ``None`` and must be set explicitly if needed.

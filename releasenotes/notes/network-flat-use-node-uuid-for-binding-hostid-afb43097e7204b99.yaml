features:
  - Adds support for `routed networks
    <https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/latest/admin/config-routed-networks>`_
    when using ``flat`` network interfaces. This feature requires the
    ``baremetal`` ml2 mechanism driver and l2 agent in
    `openstack/networking-baremetal
    <https://docs.openstack.org/networking-baremetal>`_.
upgrade:
  - |
    The ``baremetal`` ml2 mechanism driver and l2 agent is now recommended for
    use with the ``flat`` network interface. When installed, the ``baremetal``
    mechanism driver and agent ensure that ports are properly bound in the
    Networking service. Installation and configuration of the ml2 components
    are documented `here <https://docs.openstack.org/networking-baremetal>`_.

    In a configuration without the ml2 mechanism driver and l2 agent, the
    Networking service's ports will not be correctly bound. In the Networking
    service ports will have status: ``DOWN``, and binding_vif_type:
    ``binding_failed``. This was always the status for ironic ``flat`` network
    interface ports prior to the introduction of the ``baremetal`` mechanism
    driver. For a non-routed network, Bare Metal nodes can still be deployed
    and are functional, despite this port binding state in the Networking
    service.
fixes:
  - For the ``flat`` networking interface, fixes an issue where the Networking
    service would reject port bindings because no host would match the
    *host-id* used in such configurations. The ``flat`` networking interface no
    longer requires a networking agent (such as ``neutron-openvswitch-agent``)
    to be run on the ``nova-compute`` proxy node which executes the ironic virt
    driver. Instead, the interface uses the
    `baremetal mechanism driver
    <https://docs.openstack.org/networking-baremetal>`_.

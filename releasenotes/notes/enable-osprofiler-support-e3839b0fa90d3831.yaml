    Adds `OSProfiler <https://docs.openstack.org/osprofiler/latest/>`_ support.
    This cross-project profiling library provides the ability to trace various
    OpenStack requests through all OpenStack services that support it.

    To initiate OpenStack request tracing, ``--os-profile <HMAC_KEY>`` option
    needs to be added to an OpenStackClient command. As part of the output,
    there will be a message with a Trace ID.

    To see the HTML graphs, the following command should be used::

        $ osprofiler trace show <trace_id> --html --out result.html

security:
  - OSProfiler support requires passing of trace information between
    various OpenStack services. This information is securely signed
    by one of HMAC keys, defined in the ``ironic.conf`` configuration file.
    To allow cross-project tracing, the same key should be used for all
    OpenStack services.

    Adds OSProfiler support. This cross-project profiling library
    provides the ability to trace various OpenStack requests through all
    OpenStack services that support it. To initiate OpenStack request tracing,
    `--profile <HMAC_KEY>` option needs to be added to the CLI command.
    As part of the output, there will be a message with <trace_id>.
    To see the HTML graphs, the following command should be used -
    `$ osprofiler trace show <trace_id> --html --out result.html`. See
    OSProfiler documentation: http://docs.openstack.org/developer/osprofiler/.
security:
  - OSProfiler support requires passing of trace information between
    various OpenStack services. This information is securely signed
    by one of HMAC keys, defined in ironic.conf configuration file.
    To allow cross-project tracing, user should use the key that is
    common among all OpenStack services he or she wants to trace.
